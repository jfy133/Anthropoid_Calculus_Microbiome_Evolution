Small bug is the MetaPhlAn2 database doesn't come with the bioconda humann2 install.

We can link that into the directory it was looking for with the following from our local install

```bash
/projects1/users/fellows/bin.backup/miniconda3/envs/humann2/bin
ln -s /projects1/tools/metaphlan2/biobakery-metaphlan2-27f7e0c86785/db_v20/ .
```

ChocoPhlan I had already installed and it somehow picked it up (wtf?!), but
uniref wasn't installed.

```bash
/projects1/microbiome_calculus/evolution/01-data/databases/uniref90
humann2_databases --download uniref uniref90_ec_filtered_diamond "$(pwd)"
```

the humann2 utility scripts came with the conda environment.
