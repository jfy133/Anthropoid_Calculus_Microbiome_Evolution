**Important** The code in this repository was written over multiple 'learning' years by non-bioinformaticians. Quality will vary and may not be immediately re-rerunable - if you encounter any issues please leave an [issue](https://github.com/jfy133/Anthropoid_Calculus_Microbiome_Evolution/issues) and we will endevour to clarify.
